# üéÆ Digital Escape Room DApp

## Project Title
**Digital Escape Room DApp** - A blockchain-based puzzle-solving platform where players create, share, and escape from virtual rooms using smart contracts and NFTs.

## Project Vision
To revolutionize the escape room experience by leveraging blockchain technology, creating a decentralized platform where creativity meets cryptography. Our vision is to build the world's largest community-driven escape room ecosystem where players can create immersive puzzle experiences, earn NFT rewards, and compete globally while maintaining true ownership of their digital achievements.

## Project Description
The Digital Escape Room DApp is a fully decentralized application built on Ethereum that transforms traditional escape room gameplay into a blockchain-powered experience. Players can register, create custom escape rooms with puzzles and clues, join rooms created by others, solve cryptographic puzzles to unlock clues, and escape rooms to earn NFT certificates and scoring points.

The platform combines the thrill of puzzle-solving with the transparency and ownership benefits of blockchain technology. Each completed clue and escaped room generates unique NFTs that serve as permanent proof of achievement, creating a verifiable gaming reputation system.

### How It Works:
1. **Registration**: Players create unique usernames on the blockchain
2. **Room Creation**: Users design escape rooms with custom clues and solutions
3. **Exploration**: Players browse and join available escape rooms
4. **Puzzle Solving**: Solve sequential clues to progress through rooms
5. **Rewards**: Earn NFTs and points for completed challenges
6. **Achievement**: Build reputation through successful escapes and room creation
